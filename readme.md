**robots** is a small collection of simple, mostly toy-implementation of robots simulators exposing the same, simple interface. 

It allows to test learning algorithms on toy-examples first, and then move seamlessly onto physic simulators or real hardware, as long as they expose the same interface.

It was created to support code for  [experiments on sensorimotor learning](http://fabien.benureau.com). It might somehow be useful to you, especially if you want to rerun, check or tweak the aforementioned experiments.
